---Problem 5.2
Write an OpenMP program that uses Monte Carlo method to estimate π. Read in the total number of tosses before forking any threads. Use a reduction clause to find the total number of darts hitting inside the circle. Print the result after joining all threads. You may want to use long long int s for the number of hits in the circle and the number of coughs, since both may have to get a reasonable estimate of π.
